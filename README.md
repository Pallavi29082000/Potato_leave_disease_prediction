# Potato_leave_disease_prediction
(It is the project based on the convolutional neural network algorithm of machine learning in which we predict the potato leaves in three categories that is early blight, late blight and healthy with their percentage. According to project, we use 70% of dataset for training, 10% of dataset for validation and 10% of dataset for testing the model.I use some library of python i.e. Tensorflow for performance monitoring and model retraining, keras for neural network computation, matplotlib for data visualization and NumPy(numerical python) for working with array which is more faster than list in python. I use jupyter notebook and google colab notebook to implement the code of project.)
